# Introduction to Variables

Variables use for storing data.
Variables need to be defined.
let x (this defines x as a variable)
let x = 10 (this gives x an initial value of 10)


## Intro to loops and if statements
*while() loops*
> The while loop will execute code block while a condition is true or met
eg while (x< 100 ) is true perform code else halt execution

*for loops*
Often used as a counter, i is used a lot 
eg. for(let i=0;i<100;i++){ //statement }
- declare variable i and assign a value of 0
- loop continues while i is less than 100
- i++ is short hand for add 1 for each loop / iteration

*Condtionals*
== means equal to
< means less than
<= means less than or equal to
> means greater than
>= means greater than or equal to
!= means not equal to
=== means equal to and check data type

*if() statements*
if (x <100  && y > 50) can be similar to while loops, if comparison is true or condition is met then proceed

*Comparison*
&& means and (if x is true and "&&" y is true)
|| means or (if something is true)
